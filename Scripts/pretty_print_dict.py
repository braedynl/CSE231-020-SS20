'''
This file simply contains a function that prints a 
dictionary with proper indentation and newlines.

If you use print() to debug your code a lot, please
feel free to bring this function into your program and
use it for yourself. Python unfortunately doesn't do
a good job of printing large and/or nested dictionaries, 
so we have to make functions that will.

The function uses some fairly advanced Python that is
unnecessary for you to know for the purposes of this
course. Feel free to look into the concepts used here on
your own, though â€” it takes advantage of recursion and 
closures/inner-functions:
