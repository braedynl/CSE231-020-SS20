'''
There are many, many ways to go about this. Dr. Enbody
intentionally left this one open-ended to see where you guys
go and how you think. 
I'll be giving you guys a game-plan, but we want to see how
y'all organize.

# open the two datasets, "data1.txt" and "data2.txt",
# you don't make a prompt for these, hardcode it

# Initialize a dictionary to hold the names and scores

# Instead of copying and pasting code to read-in both
# datasets into the dictionary, it might be a good idea
# to make a function that can read-in either? ðŸ¤”

# You can use these print statements for the output, make
# sure you sort by name first!
# Also make sure your totals are ints!

# print("{:10s}{:<10s}".format("Name", "Total"))
# for name, total in ___?: 
    # print("{:10s}{:<10d}".format(name, total))

# You can make a main() function if you want, it's
# optional. Make sure to call it!
