## Getting Started

**Please read through the [getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) file if you're new to the course!**

If we have meetings of any kind (in-person or online), Lab 00 is treated as a homework assignment, unlike the following labs. 

Your co-pilot on this expedition through CSE231 will be the course schedule, which is down below. I have programs that keep it (and everything else on this repository) up-to-date with the main course website, though my schedule is better than Dr. Enbody's because it has links and consistent formatting. :grin:

## Course Schedule

Last Refresh: :refresh:

The assignments listed on the schedule have links to the corresponding website they are hosted on. Links to Mimir and D2L assignments are not direct because a login is required. You can hover over the assignment's text to see its precise due date (sorry mobile users).

Reading the book chapters and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week, though it's _prooobbbaaably_ a good idea to do it before coming to lab and starting the assignments. It should be assumed that all assignments are due by 11:59 PM EST on their respective days, unless specified otherwise. 

If you are in a different timezone, Mimir should automatically convert our assigned times to your computer's local time, you shouldn't need to adjust anything (though your assignments may be due at strange times of the day depending on where you live, sorry!).

**Project and lab submissions are on Mimir. The project/lab links provided bring you to the procedure and starter-code. For projects, the introductory videos are included in the subdirectory's README.**

The schedule is taken directly from the [course schedule](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/due_dates.html) on the main website. If there are any descrepancies between the two, [please notify me immediately](#braedyn-lettinga).

I sadly don't have an office or office hours since I'm a measly and pitiful ULA. I do, however, meet with students on a regular basis. Send me an email requesting a time and means of communication (in-person, Microsoft Teams, Discord, etc.), and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. You can go to the website link I have posted to check for my availability. 

I will occasionally host "help rooms" of my own when I feel it to be necessary. This is dependent on how well the section is doing as a whole, however. 

Contact **me** with questions regarding most grades. I am the one that grades your labs and projects, not the professors. Chapter exercises and exam grades are based solely on the test cases (exams are conducted through Mimir if course is online), I play no role in grading them.

## Exam Information

There will be two midterms and a final examination during the semester, and will constitute 45% of your total course grade. You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

If there are no in-person meetings, students will take exams remotely. We require a camera (e.g. phone camera). The camera should be positioned such that you, your desk, and your entire screen is in view.

- Exam 2: :exam2_details:
- Exam 3: :exam3_details:

All issues related to the final examination will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough.**
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you just have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help. This also gives you time to get answers to questions you might have.

**Take it slow.** Rushing through the coding process is bound to cause issues. You should always test as you're writing, as described by the points below. 

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Ensure that, every step of the way, you're writing a chunk or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do. Using `print()` or the debugger is good for this. 

**Talk with your friends/acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even _looking_ at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Simply _talking_ with another student about a project is fine. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Visit the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu) for more details on plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and/or instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that executes your code line-by-line. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during lab 2. Feel free to look into it on your own time as well. 

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/)!** PythonTutor visualizes your code, and gives execution control similar to an IDE debugger.
