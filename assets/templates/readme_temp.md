## Getting Started

Welcome to CSE231! I'll be hitting you with _a lot_ of information here because I like to be thorough, I apologize ahead of time. If you have never programmed before, Dr. Enbody recommends this [soft introduction to programming](https://hourofcode.com/capython). Below, I'll be explaining the course, where everything is, what's happening, etc.. 

Firstly, I recommend watching this video (think of this as your syllabus-day lecture): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-IgfhmovJc

You'll want to download/install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (comes packaged with Spyder, the code editor (IDE) that we'll be using) and Python 3.7 or higher. Further instructions are in [Lab 00](Lab%2000). There is also [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqtctVJZnk&feature=youtu.be) if you'd prefer a verbal format.

If you're interested in optimizing your code-writing, I've compiled a list of [useful keyboard shortcuts](SHORTCUTS.md) for Spyder. You'll find a lot of these more applicable after Lab 02. 

The TA "mini-lectures" and the lecture videos by Dr. Punch are _supplemental_ to the textbook. You can purchase the textbook [here](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/product/Punch-Practice-of-Computing-Using-Python-The-3rd-Edition/9780134379760.html).
- ISBN-13: 9780134379760 (or 9780134380315) 
    - Other ISBN-13 numbers are website-only, or are bundled with extraneous materials.
- Several copies are available in the Course Reserves at the MSU Main Library.
- A draft of chapters 0 and 1 can be found [here](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/chapter0_and_1.pdf) if you're waiting for shipment. 

Chapter exercise, lab, and project submissions are on Mimir. In order for your Mimir account to link with our system, you must navigate to the [CSE231 D2L page](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/home) and click the Mimir link from there. D2L will only host pre-labs and grades.

All lab and project materials can be found in the "Code" section of this repository above (if on mobile, scroll up and hit "View code"). You can find my presentations and example code in path /Lab XX/presentation/, where "XX" is the lab number. You can find more information about projects and Mimir test-case explanations in any of the [project folder READMEs](Project%2001). The assets folder is purely for my own purposes, you can ignore it. 

Please read through the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md) if you haven't already. I have a file that elaborates more on grading [here](GRADING.md), with some answers to frequently asked questions [here](FAQ.md).

Your co-pilot on this expedition through CSE231 will be the course schedule, which is down below. I have programs that keep it (and everything else on this repository) up-to-date with the main course website, though my schedule is better than Dr. Enbody's because it has links and consistent formatting. :grin:

## Course Schedule

The assignments listed on the schedule have links to the corresponding website they are hosted on. Links to Mimir and D2L assignments are not direct because a login is required. You can hover over the assignment's text to see its precise due date (sorry mobile users).

Reading the book chapters and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week, though it's _prooobbbaaably_ a good idea to do it before coming to lab and starting the assignments. It should be assumed that all assignments are due by 11:59 PM EST on their respective days, unless specified otherwise. 

If you are in a different timezone, Mimir should automatically convert our assigned times to your computer's local time, you shouldn't need to adjust anything (though your assignments may be due at strange times of the day depending on where you live, sorry!).

**Project and lab submissions are on Mimir. The project/lab links provided bring you to the procedure and starter-code. For projects, the introductory videos are included in the subdirectory's README.**

:schedule:

The schedule is taken directly from the [course schedule](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/due_dates.html) on the main website. If there are any descrepancies between the two, [please notify me immediately](#braedyn-lettinga).

### Braedyn Lettinga

Email: letting4@msu.edu

Website: https://github.com/braedynl

I sadly don't have an office or office hours since I'm a measly and pitiful ULA. I do, however, meet with students on a regular basis. Send me an email requesting a time and means of communication (in-person, Zoom, Discord, etc.), and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 

I will occasionally host help rooms of my own when I feel it to be necessary. This is dependent on how well the section is doing as a whole, however. 

Contact **me** with questions regarding most grades. I am the one that grades your labs and projects, not the professors. Chapter exercises and exam grades are based solely on the test cases (exams are conducted through Mimir if course is online), I play no role in grading them. 

If this is a summer semester: I will be sending out an email during the first week in regards to a Discord server for the section. The link to join said server will be in that email, and will not be posted on this page for sake of course privacy. I only host Discord servers for the summer sections, since the summer version of this course is harder. I would prefer student messages through Discord, since writing code in an email is glitchy.

## Exam Information

There will be two midterms and a final examination during the semester, and will constitute 45% of your total course grade. You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

If there are no in-person meetings, students will take exams remotely through Zoom. We require a camera (e.g., cellphone camera). The camera should be positioned such that you, your desk, and your entire screen is in view.

- Exam 2: :exam2_details:
- Exam 3: :exam3_details:

All issues related to the final examination will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough.**
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you just have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help. This also gives you time to get answers to questions you might have.

**Take it slow.** Rushing through the coding process is bound to cause issues. You should always test as you're writing, as described by the points below. 

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Ensure that, every step of the way, you're writing a chunk or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do. Using `print()` or the debugger is good for this. 

**Talk with your friends/acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even _looking_ at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Simply _talking_ with another student about a project is fine. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Visit the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu) for more details on plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and/or instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that executes your code line-by-line. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during lab 2. Feel free to look into it on your own time as well. 

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/)!** PythonTutor visualizes your code, and gives execution control similar to an IDE debugger.
