# CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I
This repository is for CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I, Section :section: for :semester: :year: at Michigan State University.

Below is the course schedule, so that you may check when something is due with ease. The assignments listed provide links to the corresponding website they are hosted on. Reading the book chapters and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week, though it's probably a good idea to do it before starting the assignments. You can hover over the assignment's text to see its precise due date (sorry mobile users).

If this section is in-person: labs are *not* homework assignments, they must be done in-class. 

If this section is online: labs may be treated as homework assignments. This rule also applies if there are no in-person meetings due to COVID-19, even if your section would be considered in-person by tradition. 

**Project and lab submissions are on Mimir. The project/lab links provided bring you to the procedure and starter-code. For projects, the introductory videos are included in the sub-directory's README.**

:schedule:

The schedule is taken directly from the [course schedule](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/due_dates.html) on the main website. If there are any descrepancies between the two, please notify me immediately.

Links may not be direct because of a required login for some websites.

I sadly don't have an office or office hours since I'm a measly and pitiful ULA. I do, however, meet with students on a regular basis. Send me an email requesting a time and means of communication (in-person, Zoom, Discord, etc.), and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 

I will occasionally host help rooms of my own when I feel it to be necessary. This is dependent on how well the section is doing as a whole, however. 

Contact **me** with questions regarding most grades. I am the one that grades your labs and projects, not the professors. Chapter exercises and exam grades are based solely on the test cases (exams are conducted through Mimir if course is online), I play no role in grading them. 

If this is a summer semester: I will be sending out an email during the first week in regards to a Discord server for the section. The link to join said server will be in that email, and will not be posted on this page for sake of course privacy. I only host Discord servers for the summer sections, since the summer version of this course is harder. I would prefer student messages through Discord, since writing code in an email is glitchy.

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough.**
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you just have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help. This also gives you time to get answers to questions you might have.

**Take it slow.** Rushing through the coding process is bound to cause issues. You should always test as you're writing, as described by the points below. 

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Ensure that, every step of the way, you're writing a chunk or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do. Using `print()` or the debugger is good for this. 

**Talk with your friends/acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even _looking_ at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Simply _talking_ with another student about a project is fine. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Visit the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu) for more details on plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and/or instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that executes your code line-by-line. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during lab 2. Feel free to look into it on your own time as well. 

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/).** PythonTutor visualizes your code, and gives execution control similar to an IDE debugger.
