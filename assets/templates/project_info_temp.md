# Project :n:

Due: :due: at 11:59 PM EST

Video introduction: :video_link:

The submission page for all projects are on [Mimir](https://class.mimir.io/). You can submit an infinite amount of times before the deadline. The _best_ submission is graded by the TAs (i.e. the one that passes the most test-cases). There is a 50% grade reduction for each day that a submission is late. Partial credit is rewarded by the TAs for incomplete test-cases, though the amount of partial credit rewarded varies depending on what kind of mistakes were made, how close you were to matching the test-cases, etc.. I highly recommend uploading an incomplete/blank project file at first to see the test-cases, you can extrapolate a lot more information about the project by looking at them, if the PDF was unclear in certain areas. 

Projects must adhere to the [coding standard](../CODINGSTANDARD.md). Some standards may not apply for the first couple of weeks. The standards that *do* apply will be at the bottom of the PDF, as well as some more details on the grading scheme. Points are rewarded by the TAs for following the coding standard.

Projects are meant to be completed alone. Collaboration and/or copying code from online, (e.g. Chegg), is strictly prohibited. A plagiarism-checker is ran through all projects, and checks for similarities between other students in the course and many online sources. 

Contacting [your TA](../README.md#braedyn-lettinga), using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/), and attending [help room](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/General/ta.consulting.SS20.html) is encouraged if you are struggling. Take full advantage of `print()`, [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit), and your code editor's debugger (taught in [Lab 02](../Lab%2002)). 

Read through **all** of the instructions _carefully **and** thoroughly_. If you are having trouble comprehending the instructions, please don't hesitate to ask us on Piazza.

Starter-code is given for certain projects. If the project's Python file is empty, that means there is no starter-code for the project. In the case that some starter-code is given, you will want to _add_ to what's already written. Lines that _are_ written are there to help.

When submitting to Mimir, ensure that your file is properly named. The format is "projXX.py", where "XX" is the project's corresponding number. A leading zero is used for single-digit project numbers, and alphabetical characters are always kept lowercase. If you download the files directly from this repository, this shouldn't be much of an issue.

With every project, a [`strings.txt`](strings.txt) file is included so that you can match Mimir's expected output precisely. Capitalization and spacing *does* affect whether Mimir marks your outputs as correct, and so this file is supplied to help mitigate the potential hassle you might have to go through correcting small descrepancies like that. 

If you see these two lines at the bottom of a project file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

.. do **not** delete them. Mimir will return a SIGPIPE error if you delete these lines (an indication that your program ran for an infinite amount of time -- can also occur if Mimir can't find your project file, or if your program asked for an `input()` where Mimir wasn't expecting to input anything).

## Mimir Test-Case Explanation, Fixing Diff Descrepancies

When you click on a Mimir test-case, it will show a few things: the input of the test-case (what Mimir tried entering to your `input()` prompt(s)), your code's output (self-explanatory), the correct output of the test case (what you should be outputting *based on* the input(s)), and two "diff" windows.

Think of diffs as small programs that examine the differences between your code's output and the expected output. The "unix diff" shows what lines in your output (the top-half, above the "`---`") are different from the lines in the expected output (the bottom-half, below the "`---`"). I would simply look at the unix diff window for this purpose alone. The numeric codes that you'll see, e.g. "`3,2c4,9`", tend to be hard to understand for most new programmers. The "pretty diff" is much more understandable. You can read about the unix diff [here](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/udiff.htm) if you're interested. 

The pretty diff "is colored to make it clear what parts of the output are wrong. Green indicates things in the correct output that you are missing, red indicates things in your output that shouldn't be there ... The â†µ character refers to newlines". The "newlines" they mention in this explanation is in reference to this: "`\n`" -- the newline _character_ (it's two separate characters but think of it as just one). The newline character essentially tells your computer to hit the ENTER/RETURN key. Here's an example:

Without a newline:
```python
print('hello')
print('hello again')
```
Output:
```
hello
hello again
```

With a newline:
```python
print('hello\n')  # newline concatenated to the back
print('hello again')
```
Output:
```
hello

hello again
```

It's important to note here, that the `print()` function will add a newline for you by default. This is the reason why subsequent `print()` expressions output on separate lines. You can change this behaviour by invoking the `print()` function's "`end`" parameter. 

Without `end`:
```python
print('hello')
print('hello again')
```
Output:
```
hello
hello again
```

With `end`:
```python
print('hello', end='')  # setting it to empty string
print('hello again')
```
Output:
```
hellohello again
```

Likely the most common pretty diff discrepancy you'll encounter is a space nested within your strings. Let's say I'm working on Project 01, and this is what I have so far:

Code:
```python
rods = float(input('Input rods: '))
print("You input", rods, "rods.\n")

meters = rods * 5.0292

print("Conversions")
print("Meters: ", round(meters, 3))
```
Mimir test-case:

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/images/project_info_testcases1.png"></img>
</div>

Pretty diff:

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/images/project_info_testcases2.png"></img>
</div>

There apperas to be an extra space highlighted in red. Let's take a look at the line of code that's outputting this:

```python
print("Meters: ", round(meters, 3))
```

You'll notice we have a space directly after the colon, which is what we want, right? Where is that extra space coming from? Well, when you comma-separate values in the `print()` function, Python will insert a space in-between those two values. Example:

```python
print(1, 2, 3)
```
Output:
```
1 2 3
```

So we're effectively outputting: `"Meters: "` + `" "` + `"5.029"`. 

We can alter this behaviour in a variety of ways. I typically use the "`sep`" parameter of `print()`, which specifies the string to insert between comma-separated values in the function call. 

```python
print(1, 2, 3, sep='')  # setting it to empty string
```
Output:
```
123
```

In the case of our project file, we could also remove the space after the colon to achieve the same effect:

```python
print("Meters:", round(meters, 3))
#             ^ without space

# alternate: `print("Meters: ", round(meters, 3), sep='')`
#                           ^ with space
```
Output:
```
Meters: 5.029
``` 

## Useful Keyboard Shortcuts

If you're on MacOS, all shortcuts involving CTRL use CMD instead, unless specified otherwise. Some of these shortcuts may vary between code editors -- the following are shortcuts for Spyder.

**Indentation**
- TAB
    - Indent
- SHIFT + TAB
    - Un-indent
- CTRL + ]
    - Indents current/highlighted line(s)
- CTRL + [
    - Un-indents current/highlighted line(s)

Hitting ENTER/RETURN after a colon ("`:`") will automatically indent the next line for you.

**Convenience**
- CTRL + 1
    - Comments/Un-comments current/highlighted line(s)
- CTRL + C
    - Copies highlighted text onto clipboard
- CTRL + V
    - Pastes text from clipboard
- CTRL + F
    - Finds all occurences of a given string of text
- CTRL + R
    - Finds and replaces all occurences of a given string of text with a new string of text

**Logistical/Debugging**
- F5
    - Execute file
- CTRL + F5
    - Execute file with debugger (runs program up until the first breakpoint)
- CTRL + F10
    - Steps debugger one line forward
- F12
    - Set/clear line breakpoint
- CTRL + F12
    - Steps debugger forward until next breakpoint
- CTRL + SHIFT + F12
    - Stop debugging
- CTRL + S
    - Save file
- CTRL + SHIFT + S
    - Save file as
- CTRL + C (MacOS: CTRL + C)
    - In console only. Halts file execution, useful if your program is infinitely looping, or you want to stop it early for whatever reason
- CTRL + . (MacOS: CTRL + .)
    - In console only. Restarts the console (kernel), useful if the console crashes and/or is misbehaving
