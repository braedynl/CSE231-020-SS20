Well, you're a curious one, aren't you? 

This folder is not relevant to you as a student -- you may ignore it. 

In here are programs that automatically fill-out the [README](README.md), [SYLLABUS](SYLLABUS.md), and project files for me. The project files are dynamically updated by the professors, I wanted to have them on this repository without having to *individually* download each and every file from the website, and so I wrote a program that does it for me. 

Hopefully by the time you finish this course, you'll have that same urge to automate everything ðŸ˜‰
