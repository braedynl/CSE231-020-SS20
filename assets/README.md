Well, you're a curious one, aren't you?

In here are scripts that automatically update the [README](../README.md), [SYLLABUS](../SYLLABUS.md), [course schedule](../README.md#course-schedule), and project files for me. I wanted to have the project files on here (they weren't in past semesters), but I got tired of having to individually download files and constantly check back to Enbody's website for updates. So, like any over-enthusiastic programmer, I wrote programs that do it for me. The course schedule is another big one -- I wanted the schedule to be interactable for convenience, but adding links to *every* single cell takes hours. The `update_schedule.py` file pulls directly from the [main course website's due dates page](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/due_dates.html), and constructs the same schedule but with links, hover-text and standardized formatting in HTML. Hopefully you can [see the schedule in HTML format](schedule.html) and deduce why making a program to automate this was necessary ðŸ˜…

`update.py` runs the whole operation, where the remaining `update_x.py` files update particular parts of the repository depending on what's needed where. You can view [the main update file](update.py) for more details if you're interested. There is some pretty complicated Python in these files, as a forewarning. Hopefully you get that same urge to automate everything you do on your computer after getting through this class like I did ðŸ˜‰
