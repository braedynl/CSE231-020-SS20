# CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I
This repository is for CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I, Section TBA for Fall 2020 at Michigan State University. It includes all presentations and demonstration code used during my in-class lab. This README file also acts as a hub for everything you'll need in the course. You can use this instead of the main course website if you so choose.

Below is the course schedule, so that you may check when something is due with ease. The assignments listed provide links to the corresponding website they are hosted on. Reading the book chapters and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week, though it's probably a good idea to do it before starting the assignments. You can hover over the assignment's text to see its precise due date. 

If you do not have the book yet, a draft of chapters 0 and 1 can be found [here.](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/chapter0_and_1.pdf) 

If this section is in-person: labs are *not* homework assignments, they must be done in-class. 

If this section is online: labs may be treated as homework assignments. This rule also applies if there are no in-person meetings due to COVID-19, even if your section would be considered in-person by tradition. 

**Project and lab submissions are on Mimir. The project/lab links provided bring you to the procedure and starter-code. For projects, the introductory videos are included in the sub-directory's README.**

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough.**
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Coming back to a problem the next day, or simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help.
This also gives you time to get answers to questions from instructors or Piazza.

**Take it slow.** Rushing through the coding process is bound to cause problems. You should always test as you're writing, as described by the points below. 

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Make sure that every step of the way, you're writing a block or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do. Using `print()` or the debugger is good for this. 

**Talk with your friends/acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstances, share code for the projects. Even looking at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Please check the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu) for more details on plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and/or instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that executes your code line-by-line. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during lab 2. Feel free to look into it on your own time as well. 

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/).** PythonTutor visualizes your code, and gives execution control similar to an IDE debugger.
