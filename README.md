# Braedyn Lettinga's CSE231 Section of Wonder & Amazement
This repository is for CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I, Section XXX for SS20 at Michigan State University. It includes all presentations and demonstration code used during my specific in-class lab.

My :star:***exclusive***:star: lab slides and demonstration code build upon Dr. Enbody's already laid-out TA slides. No content is omitted, content is only added upon. The content I add are things I believe you guys should be aware of going into later topics, exams and homework, in hopes that you guys can come out of the course with a 4.0 and a great coding experience.

This repository also acts as a hub for everything you need in this class. There is an overwhelming amount different websites you need to go to for this course, and so I created this repository for the benefit of you beautiful people.

After a lab is done, I will upload an example solution to it in the corresponding lab folder here in this repository.

The course follows a regular due date pattern. I have laid out the pattern below so that you can check when something is due for the week. 
Assignments listed supply links to the corresponding website they are hosted on.
Watching the lecture videos a day before lab is merely a recommendation, and the Pre-Lab/Lab table cell has two different links.

**Project submissions are on Mimir. The project link provided in the table brings you to the introductory video/code.**

Links will be updated for the corresponding week every Sunday. Currently showing week of: X/X/20 (Week 0)

## Announcements This Week (X/X/20)

Hi everyone! Welcome to CSE231! My name is Braedyn Lettinga, and I'll be leading your guys's section this semester. For a bit of background, I'm a sophomore computer science major, my focuses are mainly software engineering and data science. I've been tutoring other students for this class, CSE232, MTH132, and MTH133 for a while now, but I've finally been upgraded to a TA. 

To ensure you guys get a good programming background going forward into future CSE classes, I have specially created lab presentations that build upon Dr. Enbody's presentations that he would traditionally give us TAs to show. There's also this GitHub repository that no other section has! I made this to compile all of the many links that are required for this class so you can easily navigate to where you need to go for an assignment. We'll discuss more about this in class. 

This section of the README is for announcements and other sidenotes I think you guys should have. I'll send out an email once a week telling you guys what's changed in the repository and what to check. My specifically created lab presentations and demonstrations can be found in the corresponding "Lab XX" folder in the "code" section of the repository. After a lab is finished, I will provide an example solution in the corresponding lab folder. This, of course, will be talked about in my weekly email. 

Usually, announcements here will be discussing smaller, extra details about the content we covered in lecture and lab. I'll sometimes link recommended videos or just have further explanations on a topic we discussed.

I hope you guys have a great semester! Tell me in-person, or email me if you have questions, comments or concerns.

### Notes for this week

Dr. Enbody wants everyone to install Spyder (instructions in [Lab 00](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/week0.html))

Spyder is a fairly clean and easy to setup IDE. At some point (hopefully soon), we'll be talking about it's debugger, which is an amazing tool to help diagnose problems with your code. 

Alternatively, you can setup [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (which is what I use, and will be using for in-class demonstrations). Visual Studio Code is widely used by developers everywhere and has a ton of customizability and features compared to Spyder, in my opinion. The downside is that it can be a pain to setup.

If you're willing to get through the pain, this tutorial on how to set it up for Python is the best:

The debugger is a lot more user-friendly on VSCode compared to Spyder. When it comes time to learn about the debugger, I will show you how to use it in both Spyder and VSCode. 

## Contact Information

### Braedyn Lettinga
Email: letting4@msu.edu or braedynlettinga@gmail.com

I do not have office hours. If you want to meet me outside of lab, please email me and we can set something up. Talk to me in-person if you want my phone number or social media.

If you are having trouble with a project or exercise, think through it first, use your debugger, ask friends/acquaintances, ask on Piazza, *and then* ask me for help. Use me as a last resource.

**Do not** meet me outside lab with no progress on an assignment, especially on the day that it's due. I will not walk you through an entire assignment. It is for **you** to figure out for the most part. I will only help you with simpler dilemmas.

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough**. There is always a link for next week's project supplied below the above table so you can get started as early as possible.
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Coming back to a problem the next day, or simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help.
This also gives you time to get answers to questions from instructors or Piazza.

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Make sure that every step of the way, you're writing a block or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do.

**Talk with your friends and acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even looking at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Please check the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu/academic-integrity/academic_dishonesty_report.html) for more details about plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that can break down your code line-by-line and show you what's happening with it.

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.
