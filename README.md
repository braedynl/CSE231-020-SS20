# CSE231-020-SS20
This repository is for CSE231 - Introduction to Programming I, Section 020 for SS20 at Michigan State University. It includes all presentations and demonstration code used during my in-class lab. This README file also acts as a hub for everything you'll need in the course. You can use this instead of the main course website if you so choose. 

**As of 3/11/2020 at 12:00 PM, in-person class meetings have been suspended by MSU due to potential spread of the coronavirus, COVID-19. All operations of this course are now online. See "Section Information" below.**

Laid out below is the course schedule (taken directly from the course website) so that you can check when something is due with ease.
Assignments listed supply links to the corresponding website they are hosted on.
Reading the book chapters, and watching the lecture videos can be done at any point during the week as long as you do them before the in-class lab.

If you do not have the book yet, a draft of chapters 0 and 1 can be found [here.](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/chapter0_and_1.pdf) 

Labs (outside of Lab 00) must be completed in-class, they are not homework assignments.

**Project submissions are on Mimir. The project link provided in the table brings you to the introductory video, skeleton code and project procedure.**

## General Tips

**Start projects early, I cannot stress this enough**.
Sometimes, you might be faced with a problem that you have no idea how to implement an algorithm for. Coming back to a problem the next day, or simply taking a break and doing something else for a bit can seriously help.
This also gives you time to get answers to questions from instructors or Piazza.

**Always, always, always test your code as you're writing it.** Make sure that every step of the way, you're writing a block or line that is doing what you're expecting it to do.

**Talk with your friends and acquaintances.** If you can't figure out how to code something, discuss an algorithm or write pseudocode with your buds. Remember that you **cannot**, under any circumstance, share code for the projects. Even looking at another person's implementation of a solution may lead you to do something similar. Everything else in this course is fair game to be collaborated on. Please check the [Office of the University Ombudsperson website about ADR](https://ombud.msu.edu/academic-integrity/academic_dishonesty_report.html) for more details about plaigarism.

**Take advantage of Piazza and the help room.** These are two amazing resources to use if you're having trouble with your code. You can ask questions anonymously on Piazza and get quick responses from other students and instructors.

**Use your IDE's debugger.** The debugger is an incredible tool that can break down your code line-by-line and show you what's happening with it. We'll be covering how to use the debugger during one of the labs.

**When in doubt, `print()` it out.** Certainly the most classic of all the options. Print your variables out at certain points in your code to see where things went sour.

**Try [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/)!** PythonTutor visualizes your code and can help so much with comprehension. It can, however, only run a certain amount of lines. Good to use for small chunks of code.  

## Extra

Want to become a TA/ULA for a CSE course? You can apply [here](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Resources/EmploymentStudents.php). Undergraduate students wanting to become a ULA for CSE231 must complete CSE232 - Introduction to Programming II (or an equivalent) to be recruited.

How do people usually perform in this course? If you've ever wondered, you can look at past performance statistics [here](https://msugrades.com/course/CSE/231/RICHARD_J_ENBODY).

In this repository is a PDF of a book called "Cracking the Coding Interview". If you're looking to be a software engineer (or similar) in the future, this book is a good read before heading into a technical interview. I'm pretty sure me hosting it here is illegal, but for some reason you can find it online with just a single Google-search?? If anyone comes after me for this I would be surprised. 

In the Extra/ folder of this repository are some Python notebooks that detail some of the tricky things you'll see on Dr. Enbody's exams. Hopefully these help!
