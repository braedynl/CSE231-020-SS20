'''
Copy and paste your part a file into here!

Remember our structure from earlier? This one:
data_map = {
    "continent1": {
        "country1": ["city1", ...],
        ...
    },
    ...
}

Instead of lists inside the [continent][country] path, 
we want to make these sets!

You'll need to look at where you're creating the
lists and instead replace it with sets.

Sets, however, use a different method function in
order to add to themselves. What method function was
that again? ðŸ¤”

Find where you're appending the cities and replace that
with the set appendation method.
