The harder problems you'll see on the past exams all come from these fundamental ideas, so hopefully you're able to abstract from here. If you want me to cover anything more, or explain a certain concept better, feel free to contact me! If you're stuck on a certain problem from the past exams, I'll always be here to go through it with you!\n",
