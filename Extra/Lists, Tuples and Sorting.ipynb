    "Welcome back! Last time, we talked about quirky things in Python for Exam 1, but now we're gonna talk about something that's a bit more fun, data structures! Specifically lists and tuples, we'll be talking about two more (sets and dictionaries) fairly soon. Theoretically, you could actually code anything without a data structure, just that it would be *a lot* more work. You probably realized that on Lab05, where we had to find maxes and mins by iterating over a multitude of values and comparing each with the currently set one. \n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages come with data structures to make it so you don't have to pull your hair out doing this. What you were doing in Lab05 is actually similar to what's happening behind the scenes when you're running a function like `max()` or `min()`. You'll be learning a lot more about behind-the-scenes algorithms in CSE331 if you're a computer science/engineering major. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so let's finally talk about lists, tuples and sorting -- the main subject of today's notebook. With respect to lists, we'll be talking about list comprehension and some more things you can do with `.sort()`/`sorted()`. With tuples, we'll be talking about this concept in Python called \"unpacking\". These are small things you can easily live without in Python, so it's not really something we cover much in-class or in the lecture videos. But, I just wanted to offer this reading as an aside for anyone that's super interested in programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason we don't talk about this stuff is because these things are mostly Python-only. Features of the Python language that are *usually* not present in other languages. We're trying to get you guys to be *general* programmers, people that can think algorithmically and potentially program in *any* language. Python is, by far, my favorite language and has so many useful features as you'll see, and so in case you're also really into Python, here's some extra stuff you can do with the language!"

    "\"What's the point of list comprehension?\", you might ask. To which I would respond, \"there is no point.. other than to clean up your code\". That's right, there is *pretty much* no other reason. The thing about this though, is that clean-looking code is subjective. Some (insane) people like their code smushed together, and some (sensible) people space things out. You might prefer to initialize an empty list and append to it with a loop, which is completely okay. But the reason I'm showing you this is so that you know what it's doing when you encounter *someone else* doing it. Dr. Enbody loves having list comprehension on the exams because *he knows it's confusing*, and I believe it's really only talked about in the book -- the book that a majority of students don't buy. Evil? Possibly.\n",

Instead, we'll be talking about the sort functions already given to us in Python and what we can do with them, which does require that we talk a little bit about what's going on behind the scenes. \n",

    "Sorting is immensely useful to us humans. It's a way of quickly determining what's at the top and what's at the bottom. Computers on the other hand, don't give a shit. They can easily scan through a huge array of values and determine what's at the top and bottom using comparisons and search methods. Sorting the array first, however, might save some runtime in future calls. The computation necessary for determining the ranking for *every* item in an array is hugely complicated, and there are *hundreds* of algorithms that have been developed over the years for it. [Here's a fun little video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) that visualizes a few of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both `.sort()` and `sorted()` have a parameter called `key`, enabling you to specify *how* you want your array sorted. This is a hugely powerful tool when you don't simply want something categorized by alphanumeric order, or if you want to sort by something unique within the elements inside your array. If you had a list of lists, for example, you could sort by the length of each inner-list. If you had a list of strings, you could sort by the alphabetical order of the last character in each string. There are an infinite number of things you can do with `key`, and so it's super helpful to know how it works. \n",

That `li[-1]` will be the expression evaluated at return time for the lambda function. This of course, is mirrored in the declarative function version we made. We're taking in a parameter, calling it `li`, and returning `li[-1]` just as we're doing in the lambda function. The only difference is that lamba functions don't have names, whereas declarative functions are given one (hence the name, \"declarative\"). We use the `lambda` keyword before the rest of our function expression to signal to Python that we're creating a lambda function, where we use `def` to signal the use of a declarative function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something important that I should address is that lambda functions can only evaluate *one* expression, but can still return multiple objects (as a tuple, like we've talked about).

I would highly, highly recommend finding what you think is enjoyable and applying your programming knowledge to it. Python is great because if you want to develop a program that does *anything*, there is probably a library for it. If you want to make an AI, model a physics problem, hack your best friend, predict when the global warming apocalypse will happen, *anything*, you can almost always find a library catered for the task.

Learning *how* to program is the biggest hurdle of this major, the rest comes naturally. To be in this major however, *you have to always be willing to learn*. This field changes _fast_. Python only became the most popular programming language (over Java) within the last 15 years. The people that aren't willing to learn the new tools become dinosaurs, they're no longer useful to the market. You have to keep up with this stuff, you have to be ready, and you have to find the fun in programming for yourself. \n",
