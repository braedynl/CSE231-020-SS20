(Reading the PDF helps a lot)

Create a class called `Time()`.

I would recommend creating a constructor that takes a
parameter for the hours, minutes and seconds. You would
then pass those along to corresponding data members.

Your string representations (__str__() and __repr__()) should 
look like:
"{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}".format(?, ?, ?)

(The Mimir test cases are not rigorous at all, but do this so
that you don't need to do as much typing)

You can take A LOT of inspiration from the way Dr. Enbody
programmed his Date() class.
