Hi everyone,

So it seems like section transferring has finally calmed down a bit, which means hopefully I can now address all of you easily. 

I know there has been confusion among many students about where things are submitted, what's due and what-not, and so hopefully I can address that. If you have further questions, again, please email me and I can get back to you with more detail.

I discussed an email in-class today that I was hoping everyone had received, but there were a lot of transfers yesterday [so I'll link that email here.](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/blob/master/Emails/WEEK1-2.md) Please read all of this if you haven't already. I'm going to reiterate a lot of what was said in those past emails:
- [Mimir](https://class.mimir.io/) is where you submit labs, projects and chapter exercises
- [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/home) is where you take the pre-lab assignments
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) is where you can ask questions about coursework or anything else related to CSE231

If you were not enrolled in the Piazza or Mimir pages, go to D2L and click on the respective links from there. It should automatically link your account, or have you make a new one associated with your D2L/MSU account. 

There are so many websites to keep track of, I know (this class is poorly set up). So like I talked about in my email, you can navigate from [my repository instead](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20) if it makes more sense to you. The schedule on the README file shows when everything is due. 

Reading the book chapters, watching the lecture videos, and doing the pre-lab can all be done at any point during the week as long as it's before our physical lab meetings. D2L says that the pre-lab is due the day before lab at 11:59PM, but I will still give you credit if you do it before lab on the same day. 

I was rushing through content during my lecture today, so I likely didn't make some things clear related to the lab assignments. Lab assignments are practice sessions, they are opportunities to get more practice with the content we covered while not being graded for absolute perfection. I know that a lot of you did the lab outside of class for today, but you cannot do that for future lab sessions (sorry, Dr. Enbody rules). The incentive to do the lab is that you get to leave early, but again, you must start in-class. You also must work in pairs, but you only need to submit one lab assignment -- you and your partner will both get credit. I also got word today from Dr. Zaabar, the other leading professor, that you will have to work in pairs for the rest of the semester, so get comfy with someone in the class. I was previously only going to make you guys pair for a couple of weeks but I unfortunately have to follow my given procedures. I also noticed that some of you left without my "go ahead". Please call me over first before you leave. I know it can take a while, but it is part of my guidelines to keep you in the class until I let you. From this point on I'll be closely keeping track, this week was lenient. 

For anyone that didn't do the pre-lab or Lab 00, you should see on D2L that I gave you full credit. They're just preliminary assignments that I didn't think you guys should get docked for, especially since a lot of people were confused with the format of the class. I will not be doing this in the future, however. From here on out, you must keep track of when something is due. Speaking of which, grades are recorded on D2L, I don't think I addressed that. Do not worry about the lab assignment grades on Mimir, because I keep track of lab grades on D2L. Project and Mimir Exercise scores will be recorded on Mimir, but those will be mirrored on D2L alongside your "true" lab grades. This is also where your exam grades will go. We'll be talking more about the exams when they're closer in schedule.

[Lecture slides/code and example answers to the lab for this week can be found here.](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2001) A documented version of the example lab answer has 'c' appended to its filename, with the other including no documentation. 

Due on Saturday, 1/11/2020 at 11:59PM, are the Chapter 01 Mimir exercises. The Mimir exercises give you instructions with a small code editor. You must pass the test cases to get full points for the problem. There are usually multiple problems. You can run the test cases an unlimited amount of times until you get full points. 
- As a sidenote, when I say "test case", it refers to Mimir entering things into your code and seeing if your code gives the correct output. 

Due on Monday, 1/13/2020 at 11:59PM, is Project 01. **Project submissions are on Mimir, you can upload an unlimited amount of times before the deadline.** There is usually starter-code that you build on with your own code, where you then upload it to Mimir. If you click the "Project 01" link on my repo's README calendar, it will bring you to the project procedure (what you need to solve), an introductory video, and the starter-code. The page looks like this:

https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Projects/Project01/

Projects, like the Mimir chapter exercises, have test cases that you must pass. Most of your points are gotten this way, with some points given by me for having good variable names and some explanatory comments.  

**I would recommend starting the project sooner than later.** I'mma make damn sure ya'll know to do this. These projects get harder. If you run into problems and need assistance, make sure you leave yourself time to get help. 

Okay, hopefully this all made sense. Hopefully this will also be the last lengthy email I'll be writing. The first week of CSE231 is always confusing, I know, I've definitely been there. 

**Please write me an email if you are still confused about something.**

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
