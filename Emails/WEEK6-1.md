Wow! Another weekly email!?

Bet ya'll are really tired of me at this point. [Lab content for today is here!](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2006) Sorry to anyone who was trying to find it during class, I was creating the slides until the last minute today. In my example answer you're going to see multi-line function calls, it does nothing other than enhance readability if you're wondering what's going on with that. 

Okay so, Enbody loves tricky list questions on his exams, which especially includes list comprehensions. List comprehensions can be extremely hard to read and understand so I'm going to be making a code notebook that talks a bit more about list comprehension and some other miscellaneous things about lists and tuples I think you guys should know. I also just want you guys to be comfortable looking at list comprehensions because you'll see me use a lot of them in my example answers.

In the notebook, I'm also going to discuss some more advanced stuff you can do with .sort(). I'm unsure if it's at all talked about in the book, but when you have multi-dimensional arrays, you might want to sort by an element that is at a different index from the first within the arrays inside your parent array. You can do this using some fancy Python techniques with .sort() that I'll discuss in the notebook. 

I'll send out an email when I have the notebook finished, which could be anywhere between later today and Wednesday of next week. 

Project 4 grades will be coming back tomorrow, Project 5 is due this coming Monday (2/17/2020). No Mimir exercises this week!

Hope you guys had a great Valentine's day!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
