Subject: CSE231 Sec 020 - TA Notes (Update) (Week of 1/5/20)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Hi everyone!

Since last sending out an email, there has been 2 drops and 3, maybe 4 transfers into my section -- I am not very sure, MSU's scheduling service is still updating. (In fact, someone dropped as I was writing this email) Synopsis is, there are new people here. So this email is going to be an update for everyone who has already been enrolled into my class since the beginning, and for everyone that is new. My previous email to the students who have already been enrolled since the beginning will be copy-pasted in this email (It's very long, sorry).

Okay, so first, some further clarifications from the previous email. For anyone that's new, this might make more sense after reading the previous email down below. 

 - Lab 00 is the only lab assignment that will be done outside of our physical meetings. Since people are coming and going in all sections at the moment, it is due on 1/10/2020 at 11:59 PM. There's an associated Mimir submission box, which is where this due date comes from. You can submit it by then, but I would recommend doing it before coming to our physical meeting because we will be programming a little bit, and Lab 00 has you setting up Python and an IDE (a code editor). It says on the main course schedule that Lab 00 was due on the past Monday, but you can ignore that. Follow the Mimir submission due date instead.

 - You can read the chapters from the textbook at any point in the week. But again, reading it before lab is a recommendation because the lab assignment might make more sense that way. This also goes for the lecture videos. There are no "reading assignments" per se, but the readings combined with the lecture videos are, in a sense, the lectures for this course, which is information you will likely need going forward into other assignments, like labs and Mimir exercises. 

If you haven't bought the textbook, or don't want to whatsoever, I'm going to be discussing it in lab tomorrow because I know there might be some contention about it. For this week, Dr. Enbody supplies [a PDF](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/chapter0_and_1.pdf) of chapters 0 and 1 in case you don't have it already.

 - Pre-lab assignments on D2L give you infinite submission chances. You can keep doing them until you get 100%. (Basically just making them busywork in my opinion, I've always been an advocate for getting rid of these) 

Something I did not address previously where I should have is that I cannot give you credit on in-class labs if you don't complete the pre-labs. This is a Dr. Enbody rule. I believe it will be lenient this week, however, because people are switching sections, figuring stuff out and what-not. But again, you can continually submit them. This shouldn't be too much of an issue hopefully. 

 - I did not talk about the projects much in my previous email, there is a reason for this, and I will be discussing that reason in lab tomorrow. I will be giving you guys in-depth detail about how the projects work and what you need to do. 
 - Projects and Mimir Exercises are fixed due dates, they will almost always be due on Mondays and Saturdays respectively. I say "almost always" because sometimes there won't be projects and Mimir exercises, but note that the day in the week never changes. It's good to check the course schedule. 
 - I have specially created lab slides, but I'm **not** assigning new things whatsoever, that would be horrible. I would transfer out of my own section so fast.

If you're stressing about in-class labs, don't. It's extremely chill, you get plenty of time, and they tend to be easy. They're essentially just practice sessions. I'll be giving you guys more detail about this tomorrow.

Alright, again, if you have questions, comments or concerns, email me separately and we can talk about it. For those of you who are new to the section, welcome! I would recommend reading the email I sent to my other students below. Students who have read through it already this past Monday, you may disregard it.

Hi everyone! Sorry, this is going to be a long email...

Welcome to CSE231! My name is Braedyn Lettinga, and I'll be leading your guys' section this semester. As a bit of background, I'm a sophomore computer science major, my focus is mainly software engineering but I do quite a bit in the computational data science department as well. I've been tutoring other students for this class, CSE232, MTH132, and MTH133 for a while now, but I've finally been "upgraded" to a TA.

Some or all of you may be confused as to what the hell is happening with this class, so I'm here to hopefully give you guys some direction. 

I first want to direct you guys to [this website.](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20) This is a GitHub repository (I'll commonly refer to this as my "repo") that I've created for you guys that compiles all of the information necessary for this class. If you find the [main course website](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/) unbearably confusing (I did when I took the class), I'm providing you guys with this repository as an alternative. Hopefully everything you need is in the README.md file that you should come across when you first open the GitHub repository link. 

This repository is also where I'll be hosting my lab presentation slides. Traditionally, the leading professor, Dr. Enbody, gives the TAs presentation slides to show during lab. I personally don't believe there is enough information in them, and so I create lab slides for you guys that go a bit more in-depth (not by much, for sake of brevity). I'm hoping these extra things will make it easier for you guys to 4.0 the class and understand the material. 

I think it should go without saying that using my repo is **an option**. You **do not** need to use it if you don't want to. Any announcements I make on it will also be put into weekly emails I'll be sending you all. Likewise, I'll be sending you guys a link to that week's lab presentation in the repository as well. I'll be talking more about the repository in lab if you guys have questions about it. The traditional lab slides can be found on the main course website or on my repository. 

The biggest thing I want to stress is to **always, always, always** check the [course schedule](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/due_dates.html) for when something is due. This is pretty much your key to surviving this class. I have a re-created course schedule on the repo, with links that will bring you to the assignment and where it's hosted. Make sure you're also enrolled in the associated [D2L](https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/loginh/), [Piazza](https://piazza.com/), and [Mimir](https://class.mimir.io/) pages. These pages are for the following:

D2L - Where you will be submitting the Pre-Lab assignments (and only the Pre-Lab assignments)

Piazza - Where you can ask for help on anything related to CSE231

Mimir - Where you will be submitting chapter exercises, projects and lab assignments

If you were not enrolled into any of these websites for CSE231 this semester, talk to me during lab about it and we'll get you set up. 


Okay, I'm hoping everything is clear so far. So what's due this week, then? 


**Before you come to lab**, you must read chapter 0 and 1 of the book, complete Lab 00, watch this week's lecture videos, and complete the first pre-lab assignment. 

**On Saturday**, your first Mimir chapter exercise is due. These are usually due every Saturday, but the schedule becomes inconsistent near the end of the semester.

Lab 00 is simply setting up Python on your computer, and the Pre-Lab assignments are really quick code-reading exercises (usually) just to get you warmed up before the real lab. 

The lecture videos for each week are supplemental to the book readings. You can live without the book if you're confident in your programming and Googling abilities, but I don't recommend it.

The Mimir chapter exercises are then pretty much summations of all the content we learned for the week. These tend to be short coding exercises where you have to complete test cases to get full points for the problem. 

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Lab01 anywhere, and that's because labs are strictly to be done during the physical lab meeting. You **cannot** start the lab outside of... lab. This is Dr. Enbody's rule, not mine. (Trust me, I would have done the lab early every week to get out of there, too). We'll talk about the how the lab assignments work this week.

**Next week Monday**, is the first project due date. Project submissions are on Mimir, with associated introduction videos either on the course website, or on the project link supplied by my GitHub README calendar (they bring you to the same place).

**Start projects early.**

If there's one thing I cannot stress even more than checking the course schedule, it's to start projects early. The projects get harder as the semester progresses, so be sure you're on top of things. Piazza and the help-room are extremely helpful here, take advantage of them. That being said, I would not recommend showing up to help-room the day that the project is due. The help-room is loaded with people during those days, and the TAs have to spend a very little amount of time with people because there are just so many. If you're having trouble, start having trouble early so you have time to either get answers from Piazza, or go to different help-room days. The help-room schedule can be found on my repo or on the course website. 

I am also here to help! Which leads me to contact information...

You can email me at letting4@msu.edu, or at braedynlettinga@gmail.com -- whichever one you like better. I look at both emails equally, and I will usually respond quickly (will usually respond faster in the evenings when I'm out of class). For ease of contact, talk to me in-person if you want my phone number or social media (I only have a Snapchat, I don't really like most platforms). 

Use me as a last resource. Talk with your friends/acquaintances in this class, ask on Piazza, use your debugger (we'll talk about this later), etc., and if all else fails, email/text me and I can take a more in-depth look.  If you are having just a million different problems with something big like a project, it might be better to physically meet which I'm always happy to arrange. I'll maybe buy you a coffee in the process 😉. 

That being said, I have a rule. **I will not meet or do email/text help with you on Mondays.** I have this rule for two reasons. One, because most people will contact me on Monday for help on the project that is due for that Monday, and two, because I have back-to-back classes and a staff meeting stretching from 8:00AM to 7:00PM. I would have been willing to occasionally meet with people on Mondays if it weren't for this circumstance, but unfortunately I have a stupidly busy Monday and I need my remaining time for homework. 

If you want me, specifically, to help you in-person, the best time would be at help-room. **I am in the help-room on Sundays from 4:00-6:30PM.** This is the best time to meet for me just because of convenience, but like I said earlier, if you email/text me about arrangements outside of Mondays, we can for sure set something up. 


Okay so I think that's everything I wanted to cover for now. We'll be going over the syllabus in lab this week, and doing a very introductory lab assignment. 

I encourage you to read-through my repo at least once because there are some menial, extra things on there that I haven't talked about in this email. I will send weekly emails (usually on Saturdays, this email is introductory) containing everything you need to know from the repo, so again, you do not have to use it if you don't want to. 

Our class meets at the Engineering Building (EB), Room 3320 from 5:00-6:50PM, and we are in section 20. 

If you are not in my section and happened to have received this email, please notify me. 


See you guys in lab! Hope ya'll have a great semester! Email me back separately if you have questions, comments or concerns. 

Braedyn Lettinga
