Howdy partners,

Okay so I thought Project 03 was kinda stupid lol. I won't be docking points for repetitive code on this one since I think it's pretty inherent that you'll have a lot of repeated chunks of code. This is why we have functions in programming! You'll come to like these guys quickly, I promise. That's this weeks topic, and I would make sure you understand them thoroughly! They're a fairly difficult concept to grasp for most new programmers, and so I urge you all to read up and get practice using them. 

So the next thing I wanted to talk about in this out-of-season weekly email is the midterm. You all should have gotten an email from Dr. Zaabar recently about exam details. If you did not receive this email, check your spam folder. If you REALLY didn't receive this email, hmu and I'll get it to you.

The midterm for our lab is at Anthony Hall, room 1281. It is on Tuesday, February 4th at 7:00PM. The exam will cover everything up to and including functions. More details are in Dr. Zaabar's email, I'm not going to include them all here because this email will get long. 

So if you don't already know, the exams are multiple choice code-reading questions. The biggest thing you can do to prepare, in my opinion, is to go through the [past exams](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/) and take them as if it were the real thing. Assess yourself afterwards and try to reason through why you got each question wrong. [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/) comes in real handy with some of the more complex code chunks. Feel free to ask about the problems you see on there with me or on Piazza, as well.

For the past exams, make sure you only go through the Exam1X-XXX-Enbody forms. I would prioritize looking over the more recent ones, but going through some of the older ones could be beneficial as well. Each past exam has the answer key at the top of the form. The older exams may have topics that we haven't covered (because the course has changed structure a lot) or they might have extremely different question styles. Again, I wouldn't look at these too much, focus on the more recent ones. 

At some point this week, I'll be creating and sending you guys a code document I plan on calling: "Quirky Things in Python That Enbody Will Test You On Even Though You Won't Ever Find This Information Useful When Actually Developing". Enbody loves putting obscure Python knowledge onto his exams, and so I plan on creating a document for you guys that describes some of these quirks, why they do what they do and what-not. Still, the biggest thing is to go through the past exams. The document I'll be sending you guys will help with maybe 4-6 questions at most, and so it'll just be something that you could potentially put onto your note-sheet if you got space for it. 

We'll talk a bit more about the exam in lab this week. 

Reminder: Make sure you do the pre-lab on D2L by Thursday at 11:59PM. I cannot give you credit for the lab if you don't do the pre-lab. This counts towards your missed-labs, and you're not allowed to miss more than two. 

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
