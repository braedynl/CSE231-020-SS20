Howdy ya'll, 

Last email for this week, I promise. This is my "official" weekly email.

[Lab04 presentation and example answers here as always.](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2004) The float_check() function is brought to you by Noelle and Vinay, who amazingly wrote it in one line and without the .count() method function. Beautiful piece of code, I never would have thought of that in years. 

Okay so Exam 1 is coming, and that means I'm gonna reiterate a bunch of stuff I said earlier this week to make sure you all know. 

**Exam 1 for Friday labs are at Anthony Hall, Room 1281. It takes place on Tuesday, February 4th at 7:00PM.**

There is a review session for Exam 1 this coming Sunday, February 2nd at 6:00PM. It's at the Engineering Building, Room 1345. 

Going over the [past exams](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/) is your best study guide! It gets you a lot of practice with reading code, which is the bulk of the exam. You can find a link to the past exams on [my GitHub site's](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20) README, or on [Enbody's site](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/) through Online Content (left sidebar) -> Old Exams (left sidebar). 

Additionally, there is also my "[quirky things in Python](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/blob/master/Extra/Exam01.ipynb)" write-up that goes in-depth to talk about some of the more confusing and obscure Python knowledge Enbody loves putting on his exams. These are things you might just want to read through and maybe put a little blurb about on your note-sheet. 

Make sure to pack that note-sheet, btw. Make it stuff you don't have memorized, and make it general so you can apply the concepts to multiple different scenarios. You get a single sheet of paper, front and back. No electronic devices are allowed.

Okay so I'm also going to, again, remind you all about the Pre-Labs. Here is a hastily drawn arrow I plastered onto a screenshot in MSPaint that depicts the location of the Pre-Labs on D2L, since I heard some people were having trouble finding it.

Follow the due dates and times as shown on D2L. You have unlimited submissions before the deadline. As stated many times now, I cannot give you credit for the in-class lab if you don't do the pre-lab. A couple of you got that talk today and I apologize for it -- I really don't like giving out 0s. Most of you have not missed a pre-lab or a lab. If you got 100% on all of the labs so far on D2L, then you know that you haven't missed either. Most of the time, students will save their 2 free lab absences to use for the end of the semester. 

Another thing that I feel I should remind you all of, is that if you're ever guaranteed to miss a physical lab session for something like a job interview, social event, or anything else that's extremely important to you, email me beforehand and I can give you an excuse. This usually means, however, that you still need to do the Pre-Lab and the In-Class Lab but on your own time before the submission deadline on Mimir. 

Project 03 grades will come back tomorrow. 

Mimir Exercises Ch.5 is due on 2/1/2020 at 11:59 PM (tomorrow at the time of writing), and the next project isn't due until 2/10/2020 at 11:59 PM since next week is the exam. Get started early, as always. 

I wish you all the best of luck on Exam 1! Contact me if you're confused about a past exam question, or anything else. 

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
