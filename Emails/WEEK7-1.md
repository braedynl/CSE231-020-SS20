Howdy everyone!

It's finished, my notebook on [lists, tuples and sorting](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/blob/master/Extra/Lists%2C%20Tuples%20and%20Sorting.ipynb)! Completely optional to read through, but might be helpful to know about some of these things for future projects and exams. When exam 2 is closer, I'll include everything from this notebook in my exam 2 notebook for you guys. 

In the notebook, I talk about list comprehension, tuple unpacking, and sort functions. We don't spend much time on these things because you can easily live without them, but knowing some of these techniques can make your code a lot cleaner and a whole lot more concise. Sort functions are probably the most useful techniques to know for future projects and programming in general. I also tackle some example problems in the notebook where these techniques can be applied. 

Also, you guys probably noticed that the project 04 grades came a bit later than usual. I got pretty slammed with homework and normal work during the weekend so it slipped my mind, sorry about that, won't happen again hopefully. 

We won't be covering anything extremely new this week since lists and tuples are a pretty big topic that we like to spend a bit more time on. Next week we'll talk about the other two data structures in Python, dictionaries and sets. 

Have a great week!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
