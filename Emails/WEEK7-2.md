Hello once again, 

Alright so hopefully Enbody won't make more labs like the one we just had. [Presentation, example answer(s), and demonstration code are here like always](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2007). This time, I decided to whip up some more versions of the example answer I made:
- lab07.py - Traditional example lab07 answer, undocumented
- lab07c.py - Traditional example lab07 answer, documented
- lab07adv.py - Advanced example lab07 answer, undocumented
- lab07advc.py - Advanced example lab07 answer, documented

The "Advanced" example answers heavily take advantage of list comprehension, which I know is something that might be confusing right now so I made the two separate versions. I'm going to not-so-subtly remind you all of [my notebook on list comprehension and sorting functions](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/blob/master/Extra/Lists%2C%20Tuples%20and%20Sorting.ipynb), which might help you understand them a bit better. Again, using list comprehensions is completely optional, but Enbody likes putting them on the exams, so I would get comfortable looking at them. Sort functions are extremely helpful in general, I would highly recommend getting to know them even if they don't appear that often on the exams. I'll be putting this stuff on the exam 2 notebook I'll be making, but I want to expose you guys to this stuff as much as possible before exam 2 for the extra reinforcement.

So about course grades.. I'm not exactly sure why, but as you can probably tell, there is no way to check your overall grade in this class. Recently, I made a Microsoft Excel gradebook (similar to the ones they make for the MTH132/133/234 classes) for you guys. You'll be able to enter what score you got on the projects, exams, and Mimir exercises to easily see your calculated course grade. To make sure all of the calculations are correct, I'm going to verify with Dr. Enbody on Monday when I have my TA meeting. The soonest I can get it to you guys, then, will likely be between Monday the 23rd to Tuesday the 24th. The gradebook may become public for everyone in the course to use, so you might instead see an email from Dr. Enbody next week. 

Also at some point next week, I'll be sending out a poll gauging your guys' opinions on the course so far, what you guys think should be changed about the course structure, what you guys want to see in lab, etc.. I have a lot of strong opinions on this course that I'm always pushing onto Enbody, but I also need to know what the majority wants so I can relay that to the man himself. I personally think that the pre-labs shouldn't exist (or at least be moved to Mimir), there should be at least one project drop, and Mimir test cases shouldn't be as strict on output formatting. I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on this stuff, and while nothing course-changing will happen this semester, you guys could really help out future students coming into this class. 

All project grades up to and including project 5 should have been released on Mimir. Additionally, all of the project grades have been mirrored onto D2L as of last night, and should be mirrored on D2L immediately from here on out. A couple of you have asked about the exam 1 grades and when they'll be put onto D2L. Dr. Enbody and Dr. Zaabar are the ones who put those in, not me. In terms of time frame, I have no idea, but I'll get back to you guys on this when I meet with Dr. Enbody on Monday. You all should have gotten your exam 1 grades back in a student report email a while back, I would keep that handy so you can log it on the gradebook that I'm hoping to get approved on Monday. 

Mimir Exercises Ch.7 is due Saturday, 2/22/2020 11:59 PM. Project 6 is due Monday, 2/24/2020 11:59 PM, Enbody loves hockey.. so project 6 is about hockey statistics lmao. 

Alrighty, I think that's it. Contact me if you have any questions!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
