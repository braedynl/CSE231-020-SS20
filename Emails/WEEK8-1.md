Hey everyone,

So hopefully you guys received Dr. Enbody's email, if not, here's what it was:

> For the Friday before Spring Break, CSE 231 Sections 016 - 025 will have the option of doing the lab on their own with submissions to Mimir instead of attending the lab session.  It will be due on Saturday, March 7, i.e. the Saturday of Spring Break.  TAs will be running labs as normal for those who wish to attend.  Of course, students get to miss two labs and could use this lab as one of those.

My routine is going to be mostly the same, I'll have hints for the lab and my presentation up by Friday if any of you want to look at them. I'll be releasing an example answer after March 7th since you guys will have to do it on your own time if you decide to skip Friday. For anyone that's coming Friday, I'll be letting you guys go fairly early and you'll instantly get credit for the lab even if you don't complete it since that's just how the lab traditionally works. 

If you have any questions about the lab, feel free to contact me or ask on Piazza. I will be answering questions during spring break as well, don't hesitate to email/text me if you're working on the lab during break haha. 

For anyone wondering about the student Excel gradebook status, me and Dr. Enbody are discussing some of the calculations at the moment so it might be a bit until we release it. It will be made public to all students in the course to use, I'm just telling ya'll since you guys are the only ones that know of it right now. 

For anyone that meets me outside of class regularly, I'll be in Grand Rapids by late Friday night, so contact me about meeting up anytime before then. 

Alright, I think that's it! Hope you guys have a great spring break!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
