Hellooooo everyone,

I really didn't think I would be writing this email lol. So as I'm sure you're all aware, in-class meetings have been cancelled due to concern over COVID-19. This, of course, includes the CSE231 labs. All operations of this class will be moved online.

Dr. Enbody and Dr. Zaabar are currently working on full details, an email will be sent out later today. The professors and TAs are all panicking right now so bear with us.

To emulate our in-class labs, we will be using Zoom -- more details coming later in that email. In terms of how lab grading is going to work is being discussed right now. I would, for the time being, at least look at or start work on this week's lab since everyone is kinda wingin' it.

I think that at this point, I'm just going to give you guys my phone number in case you ever have questions that necessitate a quick response and/or if emailing is too cumbersome: 616-334-8085. Contact me whenever, I will often respond immediately.

Alrighty, like I said, full details coming later in an email from either Dr. Enbody or Dr. Zaabar. Discussion is being had on everything about this course that I did not touch on, like Exam 2. 

Stay safe, I'll miss seeing y'all ðŸ¥º

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
