Subject: CSE231 Sec 020 - Another Weekly Email From Your Talkative TA (Week of 1/19/2020)

Hello all, 

[As always, content from this week's lab can be found here.](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2003)

As a reminder, pre-labs (on D2L) are due the day before the in-class lab at 11:59PM. I cannot give you credit for the in-class lab if you do not complete the pre-lab. I know they suck, but as I've said before, you can do them an infinite amount of times before the deadline. I gave everyone credit for the pre-labs this week in case any of you didn't receive this memo from last week's email. This is unfortunately going to be the last time I can do this. 

Project 02 grades and feedback should be coming back at some point this weekend. 

Mimir Exercises Ch.4 is due tonight (1/25) at 11:59PM, and Project 03 is due Monday (1/27) at 11:59PM, both are on Mimir like always.

Best,
Braedyn Lettinga
