Howdy!

[Lab 10 content is here!](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2010) Same thing as always, 'c' signifies my documented version of the lab answers, no 'c' is undocumented. Part b of the lab is very open-ended. You could tackle it in a variety of different ways.

So, hopefully as you guys heard yesterday before my mini-lecture, we (the TAs and Dr. Enbody/Dr. Zaabar) have recently decided to let students in the traditional lab sections (like this one) treat the course as if it were the online section, meaning that *you are allowed to not attend the lab Zoom sessions __in exchange for all Mimir test-case passes__*. If you're adamant on not hearing me ramble for ~20 minutes, this is your getaway card!  

For those of you who will be continuing with our labs like we've been doing, I know that there are some of you not attempting the labs at all ðŸ¤”. I would encourage you to at least give the lab a starting shot because a lot of the principles applied in the labs can carry over to projects. Getting practice with the concepts is vital to success in this class, and can save you a lot of time debugging and waiting for someone else's answer on Piazza. This becomes especially relevant with classes, since everything we've learned up to this point is going to be used with, and inside classes that we'll be creating next week. 

But, if you're the kinda person that prefers to work it all out come project time, go for it. Do what you think is best for your learning! That card/deck class is used for an upcoming project, by the way. 

Important due dates:
- Project 7 is due on Monday, 3/23/2020 at 11:59 PM. 

No Mimir exercises due today! (3/21/20) There'll be one next week that has you create two classes of your own. I'll be giving you guys a bonus video this coming Wednesday covering similar problems to the exercises, since I know classes can be hard to understand at first.

Let's talk about exams really quick. As a preface, we have about 760 students enrolled in CSE231. 

For Exam 2, we had about 400 students get 90% or above. To put that in perspective, we had about 150 students get 90% or above on Exam 1. Hmm... I wonder what happened.. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”. We went into Exam 2 knowing that students would cheat -- we didn't have time to setup anything substantial to combat cheating, so as you might now expect, the Final Exam will be conducted differently. It's still in the works, but we're currently discussing a Mimir-exercise-style format. Nothing is set in stone at the moment, but expect to be programming for the final. We'll of course be running a plagiarism checker through the submissions. More details will become available as the final exam approaches. 

Last thing I wanted to talk about is my help-room days. I typically do help-room on Sundays from 4-6:30 PM. But, since help-room has transitioned to become the TAs just monitoring Piazza for a dedicated slot of time, I thought it might be a good idea to additionally hold a Zoom session for you guys if any of you need help on the projects. Stop on by at any point and I'll be free to help you through and answer any questions you might have. I'll be a lot better prepared to answer project questions tomorrow since I have to know how to do it to properly answer people's questions on Piazza. I'll be sending out Zoom details tomorrow. 

Always feel free to text me with questions as well! (616-334-8085) I have way too much free time now that I don't have classes to regularly attend. I am bored out of my mind.  

Alrighty, I think that's all I got for now. Have a great weekend! Get started on the project!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
