What's poppin,

Lab09 example answers and presentation can be found here. Lab09 confused a lot of people it seems, so after we wrapped up yesterday, I recorded a video going through it if you want to understand the process:

I realize that I talk slow, so you might want to adjust the speed in the Youtube settings lmao. After lab was over, I went through it with a few of you over Zoom. I'll be doing this every lab, but I won't always be creating a video since it takes a lot of time (I process videos in HD, I do retakes if I'm not satisfied with it, etc.). I created a video during Spring break on our next topic, classes, that I'll be sending out to you guys next week.

For being a first Zoom meeting, I don't think it went that.. badly? But I do think I'm going to change some things. Of course I'm not gonna change stuff without the opinions of you guys though, and so I have a poll here for the people that made it to lab yesterday. You might be prompted to sign into a Google account, but the poll is optionally anonymous. It has you sign in to a Google account so you cannot submit more than once. Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to fill out, maybe 10 if you're feeling spicy:

If you could fill it out before next class, that would be *extremely* helpful to me! As I said during our first meeting, my exam 2 notebook is now up on GitHub (much better viewed on a computer):

Again, this is not to be used as a full study guide, it only talks about more complicated problems that you'll sometimes see. Quiz yourself using the [past exams](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/) (now the Exam2X-XXX-Enbody forms). Make sure to study, get some sleep, and drink some coffee before the exam next week ([new study came out recently about beneficial coffee effects on problem-solving, very interesting read!](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810019303435?via%3Dihub#!)). I unfortunately don't know much about how the exam is going to operate other than that it'll be conducted via D2L. More details are probably coming (don't take my word on this). If you have more in-depth logistical questions about the exam, I would email either Dr. Enbody (enbody@cse.msu.edu) or Dr. Zaabar (zaabarim@cse.msu.edu). 

Important dates coming up:

- Mimir Exercises Ch.8 and Ch.9 are due tonight, 3/14/2020 at 11:59 PM EST.
- Exam 2 Review Session will be tomorrow, 3/15/2020. Zoom details and time will be sent out at some point soon, hopefully?
- Exam 2 will be conducted via D2L on 3/17/2020 at 7:00 PM EST.

For those of you who are in different time zones, please make note that all of these are in EST. If you don't want to have to convert yourself, contact me about your time zone and I can work it into future emails for you.

Was really happy to see you guys again! A large part of why I wanted to be a TA was to be *with* my students to help them on things, it's not really the same to me being online and what-not. Stay safe, y'all.

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
