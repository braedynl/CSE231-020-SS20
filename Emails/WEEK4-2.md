Alright guys,

Here it is, my completed notes, *Quirky Things in Python That Enbody Will Test You On Even Though You Won't Ever Find This Information Useful When Actually Developing*.

https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/blob/master/Extra/Exam01.ipynb

So I essentially compiled a bunch of the weird and obscure things I saw on the past exams into a Jupyter notebook (like a notebook but for programming, highly recommend looking into it for yourself). Like I said before, Enbody loves to put tricky things on his exams, and so hopefully this can explain some of these quirks, what they do, etc.. If you're confused about something on there, or anything else you find on the past exams, feel free to hmu. 

For anyone that uses my repository on a regular basis, the folder path is Extra/Exam01.ipynb 

You shouldn't need to download the document, GitHub can represent the notebook in-site. I would recommend looking at it on a computer, things might get squished or hard to read on mobile. 

Also, like I said in the previous email, go over a bunch of the past exams. That's really going to be your best study guide. Make sure to pack your single note-sheet with everything you think you'll need. 

When Exam 2 and the Final come along, I'll make more versions of this notebook that will include more tricky stuff with the extra content. I won't be proctoring for Exam 1, so I won't see you guys there, but I wish you all the best of luck. Study hard, drink loads of coffee, eat healthy and do the pre-lab before Friday.

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
