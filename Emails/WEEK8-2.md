Hello there,

I know that CSE231 is probably the last thing you want to have on your mind right now, but to those of you who did not attend lab this past Friday are to submit your lab 08 to Mimir by 3/7/2020 at 11:59 PM, just as a reminder. Note that you will have to pass the test cases to get credit. Like the in-class lab, however, you can still feel free to work on it with others and ask for help. I'll be more than willing to help during the entirety of Spring break, and Piazza will always be open. Example answers are, of course, not available right now. [However, my presentation and demonstration code for this past Friday are available, as well as some hints I've written up](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-020-SS20/tree/master/Lab%2008). There are two hint files, 'lab08ah.py' and 'lab08bh.py', which are aptly named for parts 'a' and 'b' of the lab. Mimir will aggressively demand you to upload both lab files, one named 'lab08a.py' and the other 'lab08b.py'. The lab document explains what you need to do for each, lab08a is some code editing (the debugger is useful for this), and lab08b is an open-ended problem for you to solve similar to the past labs. If you have part 'a' of the lab done and want to test it without having part 'b' done, you can make an empty 'lab08b.py' file and just upload that alongside your part 'a' file.

Note that when you come back from break, Mimir Exercises Ch.8 _**and**_ Ch.9 are due on 3/14/2020 at 11:59 PM. Project 7 isn't due for close to a month, being 3/23/2020 at 11:59 PM, since you have Exam 2 on 3/17/2020. Exam 2 details will be released by Dr. Enbody at some point after break I suspect. I'll be creating an Exam 2 notebook over the course of break and some other things I have planned for when we start talking about Python "classes". Classes are a notoriously difficult topic for people, and so I'm hoping to get you guys some extra resources to make it easier to understand them. 

Alrighty, that's all I got. Enjoy your spring break! Feel free to contact me about anything!

Best,

Braedyn Lettinga
