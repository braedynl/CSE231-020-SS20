# Project 2

Projects are meant to be completed alone. Collaboration and/or copying code from online, (e.g. Chegg), is strictly prohibited. A plagiarism-checker is ran through all projects, and checks for similarities between other students in the course and many online sources. 

Contacting your TA, using Piazza, and attending help-room is encouraged if you are struggling. Take full advtange of `print()`, [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit), and your code editor's debugger (taught in [lab 02](../Lab%2002)). 

Always read through the PDF instructions _carefully and thoroughly_. If you are having trouble comprehending the instructions, please don't hesitate to ask us on Piazza.

Starter-code is given for certain projects. If the project's Python file is empty, that means there is no starter-code for the project. In the case that some starter-code is given, you will want to _add_ to what's already written. Lines that _are_ written are there to help.

When submitting to [Mimir](https://class.mimir.io/), ensure that your file is properly named. The format is "projXX.py", where "XX" is the project's corresponding number. A leading zero is used for single-digit project numbers, and the alphabetical characters are always kept as lowercase. If you download the files directly from this repository, this shouldn't be much of an issue, as I have scripts that properly name them for you.

If you see these two lines at the bottom of a project file,

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

do **not** delete them. Deleting these lines will result in a SIGPIPE error (an indication that your program ran for an infinite amount of time -- can also occur if Mimir can't find your project's file).
