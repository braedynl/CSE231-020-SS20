## Lab 00 Covers:

- Setting up Spyder & Python

This lab has no associated presentation. It is to be done outside of class before Lab01 (this is the only lab that is going to be done outside of class). I believe there is also an associated submission on Mimir for it. You can go to the README or main course website to find it.
