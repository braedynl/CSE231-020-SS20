# How Grading Works

### Where are the grades?

Pre-lab, lab and project grades will be posted on D2L by yours truly. If you want to discuss a grade you had recently received, or if there is a mismatch between your Mimir and D2L grades, [contact _me_](README.md#braedyn-lettinga) -- not the professors. 

I address other miscellaneous grading questions in the [FAQ](#FAQ.md).

### Points/Grading Scale

A total of 1000 points are accrued from the weekly projects (45%), exercises (10%), and exams (45%). Exams become worth more as the semester progresses (see below). Labs do not support your grade, they can only hinder it under certain conditions (see below). You might come to find that the sum of chapter exercise points is double the amount it should be -- this is a correct observation. The summation of points is summed and then halved before contributing to your overall course grade at the end of the semester. 

Grading scale:
- 4.0 - 90% of points available
- 3.5 - 85% of points available
- 3.0 - 80% of points available
- 2.5 - 75% of points available
- 2.0 - 70% of points available
- 1.5 - 65% of points available
- 1.0 - 60% of points available

**Important**: to be eligible for a non-zero course grade, a student must earn at least 50% of the total points on exams, and earn at least 50% of the total points on computer projects.

**Important**: students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

Further breakdown (Fall/Spring Semester):
  
|         | Chapter Exercises | Projects | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 | Total |
| :---:   | :---:             | :---:    | :---:  | :---:  | :---:  | :---: |
| Percent | 10%               | 45%      | 10%    | 15%    | 20%    | 100%  | 

Further breakdown (Summer Semester):

|         | Chapter Exercises | Projects | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Total |
| :---:   | :---:             | :---:    | :---:  | :---:  | :---: |
| Percent | 10%               | 45%      | 15%    | 30%    | 100%  | 

Some extra credit opportunities _may_ be presented throughout the semester, though I wouldn't place too much hope in it.

### Pre-Labs

- Hosted On: D2L
- Graded By: D2L
- Assignment Style: Multiple Choice
- Collaboration: Allowed

Pre-labs are small multiple choice assignments intended as warm-ups for the real lab. They're to get you thinking about the concepts, and double as practice for the exams (the exam questions follow a _very_ similar format). Pre-labs can be retaken an infinite number of times before the deadline. There is an associated pre-lab for every lab, and are (for some reason) hosted on D2L. 

From the syllabus:
> Pre-labs are "warm-ups" for the labs and are not expected to be perfect -- our expectation is intentionally fuzzy for the pre-labs. You are expected to get most of them correct, most of the time.

### Labs

- Hosted On: Submissions on Mimir, procedure and starter-code on the course website/GitHub
- Graded By: Mimir, TA
- Assignment Style: Coding
- Collaboration: Allowed

Labs are meant as practice material for all other assignments in the course. Because of this, labs are graded leniently, and follow a pass/fail scheme. The way labs are treated is dependent on your semester (see below). Lab submissions are on Mimir, and have test-cases so that you may check your work. Labs can be submitted an infinite number of times before the deadline.

From the syllabus:
> Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four (4) zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

**Summer Semester, 730 Sections**

Labs are treated as homework assignments. The due dates for all are reflected on the course schedule and Mimir. 

**Fall/Spring Semester, Sections 001-025**

Labs are not homework assignments. You may read through the procedure and begin planning beforehand, but you may not begin coding. You'll do the lab assignments with me and your classmates at the scheduled meeting time (whether that be in-person or online).  

If meetings are online for whatever reason, (e.g. COVID-19), you can miss the meeting _in exchange_ for 100% test-case completion. Anything less will be regarded as a 0%, even if sufficient effort was put in. 

### Chapter Exercises (10%)

- Hosted On: Mimir
- Graded By: Mimir
- Assignment Style: Coding, Multiple Choice
- Collaboration: Allowed

Chapter exercises are relatively small coding/multiple choice assignments on Mimir that ask about the fundamental concepts you learned for the week. The programs you must create are described in the assignment itself. 

When coding is necessary, Mimir will give you an integrated code editor. You may code on a local code editor, (like Spyder), but you'll ultimately have to copy-paste your code from Spyder into Mimir's integrated window for feedback. Test-cases are provided. 

The TAs do _not_ grade chapter exercises. Any and all points are accrued from the test-cases (or if the option you selected was correct, in the case of a multiple choice question). 

### Projects (45%)

- Hosted On: Submissions on Mimir, procedure and starter-code on the course website/GitHub
- Graded By: Mimir, TA
- Assignment Style: Coding
- Collaboration: Disallowed

Projects are larger coding assessments that test your problem-solving abilities with the concepts you learned from the preceding week. 

Collaboration is strictly prohibited. Project files are sent to an online system that checks for similarities between other student project files (including ones from past semesters) and numerous websites (e.g. Chegg, StackOverflow, YahooAnswers, etc.). If your project is too similar to another source, an academic dishonesty report will be filed with the university, and you will receive a 0% overall course grade (see [FAQ](#FAQ.md)).

Unlike labs, project test-cases are treated with much more weight. You should strive to pass all of them. If a test-case is missed, the TA will look for partial credit opportunities. The amount of partial credit rewarded is dependent on a number of factors, however (e.g. what kind of mistakes were made, what would be required to fix it, how close you came, etc.). 

If your _vital_ outputs are correct (e.g. values you could only obtain through an algorithm that had to be developed), but there are small spacing/formatting descrepancies in your output strings, I will recover most, if not all points for the affected test-case(s). I'm expecting that most of your output strings are correct.

### Exams (45%)

**Summer Semester**

You will have one midterm and a final. 

Further breakdown:
- Exam 1: 15% of total course points
- Exam 2: 30% of total course points

**Fall/Spring Semester**

You will have two midterms and a final.

Further breakdown:
- Exam 1: 10% of total course points
- Exam 2: 15% of total course points
- Exam 3: 20% of total course points

**All Semesters**

All issues related to the final exam will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

If there are in-person meetings: we will have paper multiple choice exams. See the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md#exams) for locations/times. 

If there are no in-person meetings: exams will be on Mimir, and will contain both multiple choice and coding questions. You will be proctored through Zoom. See the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md#exams) for times. 

You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

The amount of points per question varies by exam format, and which exam it is. In all cases, you should review the [past exams](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/). If you'll be taking the exam on Mimir, I recommend going back through labs, projects, and chapter exercises (doing them if you never did, or designing alternate methods if you have all of them completed).
