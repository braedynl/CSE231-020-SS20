# How Grading Works

### Where are the grades?

Pre-lab, lab and project grades will be posted on D2L by yours truly. If you want to discuss a grade you had recently received, or if there is a mismatch between your Mimir and D2L grades, [contact _me_](README.md#braedyn-lettinga) -- not the professors. 

I address other miscellaneous grading questions in the [FAQ](#faq) at the bottom of this document. 

### Points/Grading Scale

A total of 1000 points are accrued from the weekly projects (45%), exercises (10%), and exams (45%). Exams become worth more as the semester progresses (see below). Labs do not support your grade, they can only hinder it under certain conditions (see below). You might come to find that the sum of chapter exercise points is double the amount it should be -- this is a correct observation. The summation of points is summed and then halved before contributing to your overall course grade at the end of the semester. 

**Important**: to be eligible for a non-zero course grade, a student must earn at least 50% of the total points on exams, and earn at least 50% of the total points on computer projects.

**Important**: students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

Grading scale:

- 4.0 - 90% of points available
- 3.5 - 85% of points available
- 3.0 - 80% of points available
- 2.5 - 75% of points available
- 2.0 - 70% of points available
- 1.5 - 65% of points available
- 1.0 - 60% of points available

Further breakdown (Fall/Spring Semester):

|         | Chapter Exercises | Projects | Exam 1 | Exam 2 | Exam 3 |       | Total |
| :---:   | :---:             | :---:    | :---:  | :---:  | :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Percent | 10%               | 45%      | 10%    | 15%    | 20%    |       | 100%  | 
| Points  | 100               | 450      | 100    | 150    | 200    |       | 1000  |

Further breakdown (Summer Semester):

|         | Chapter Exercises | Projects | Exam 1 | Exam 2 |       | Total |
| :---:   | :---:             | :---:    | :---:  | :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Percent | 10%               | 45%      | 15%    | 30%    |       | 100%  | 
| Points  | 100               | 450      | 150    | 300    |       | 1000  |

Some extra credit opportunities _may_ be presented throughout the semester, though I wouldn't place too much hope in it.

### Pre-Labs

- Hosted On: D2L
- Graded By: D2L
- Assignment Style: Multiple Choice
- Collaboration: Allowed

Pre-labs are small multiple choice assignments intended as warm-ups for the real lab. They're to get you thinking about the concepts, and double as practice for the exams (the exam questions follow a _very_ similar format). Pre-labs can be retaken an infinite number of times before the deadline. There is an associated pre-lab for every lab, and are (for some reason) hosted on D2L. 

From the syllabus:
> Pre-labs are "warm-ups" for the labs and are not expected to be perfect -- our expectation is intentionally fuzzy for the pre-labs. You are expected to get most of them correct, most of the time.

### Labs

- Hosted On: Submissions on Mimir, procedure and starter-code on the course website/GitHub
- Graded By: Mimir, TA
- Assignment Style: Coding
- Collaboration: Allowed

Labs are meant as practice material for all other assignments in the course. Because of this, labs are graded leniently, and follow a pass/fail scheme. The way labs are treated is dependent on your semester (see below). Lab submissions are on Mimir, and have test-cases so that you may check your work. Labs can be submitted an infinite number of times before the deadline.

From the syllabus:
> Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for _each laboratory exercise missed beyond two_. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but obtained four (4) zeroes on the laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5, i.e. they will earn a 2.0 course grade.

**Summer Semester, 730 Sections**

Labs are treated as homework assignments. The due dates for all are reflected on the course schedule and Mimir. 

**Fall/Spring Semester, Sections 001-025**

Labs are not homework assignments. You may read through the procedure and begin planning beforehand, but you may not begin coding. You'll do the lab assignments with me and your classmates at the scheduled meeting time (whether that be in-person or online).  

If meetings are online for whatever reason, (e.g. COVID-19), you can miss the meeting _in exchange_ for 100% test-case completion. Anything less will be regarded as a 0%, even if sufficient effort was put in. 

### Chapter Exercises (10% of total course points)

- Hosted On: Mimir
- Graded By: Mimir
- Assignment Style: Coding, Multiple Choice
- Collaboration: Allowed

Chapter exercises are relatively small coding/multiple choice assignments on Mimir that ask about the fundamental concepts you learned for the week. The programs you must create are described in the assignment itself. 

When coding is necessary, Mimir will give you an integrated code editor. You may code on a local code editor, (like Spyder), but you'll ultimately have to copy-paste your code from Spyder into Mimir's integrated window for feedback. Test-cases are provided. 

The TAs do _not_ grade chapter exercises. Any and all points are accrued from the test-cases (or if the option you selected was correct, in the case of a multiple choice question). 

### Projects (45% of total course points)

- Hosted On: Submissions on Mimir, procedure and starter-code on the course website/GitHub
- Graded By: Mimir, TA
- Assignment Style: Coding
- Collaboration: Disallowed

Projects are larger coding assessments that test your problem-solving abilities with the concepts you learned from the preceding week. 

Collaboration is strictly prohibited. Project files are sent to an online system that checks for similarities between other student project files (including ones from past semesters) and numerous websites (e.g. Chegg, StackOverflow, YahooAnswers, etc.). If your project is too similar to another source, an academic dishonesty report will be filed with the university, and you will receive a 0% overall course grade (see [FAQ](#faq)).

Unlike labs, project test-cases are treated with much more weight. You should strive to pass all of them. If a test-case is missed, the TA will look for partial credit opportunities. The amount of partial credit rewarded is dependent on a number of factors, however (e.g. what kind of mistakes were made, what would be required to fix it, how close you came, etc.). 

If your _vital_ outputs are correct (e.g. values you could only obtain through an algorithm that had to be developed), but there are small spacing/formatting descrepancies in your output strings, I will recover most, if not all points for the affected test-case(s). I'm expecting that most of your output strings are correct.

### Exams (45% of total course points)

**Summer Semester**

You will have one midterm and a final. 

Further breakdown:

- Exam 1: 15% of total course points
- Exam 2: 30% of total course points

**Fall/Spring Semester**

You will have two midterms and a final.

Further breakdown:

- Exam 1: 10% of total course points
- Exam 2: 15% of total course points
- Exam 3: 20% of total course points

**All Semesters**

All issues related to the final exam will follow the policies and schedule of the University.

If there are in-person meetings: we will have paper multiple choice exams. See the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md#exams) for locations/times. 

If there are no in-person meetings: exams will be on Mimir, and will contain both multiple choice and coding questions. You will be proctored through Zoom. See the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md#exams) for times. 

You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.

The amount of points per question varies by the exam format, and which exam it is. In all cases, you should review the [past exams](https://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/). If you'll be taking the exam on Mimir, I recommend going back through labs, projects, and chapter exercises (doing them if you never did, or designing alternate methods if you have all of them completed).

## FAQ

Frequent student questions that I've been collecting over the years. If the answer to your question ain't in here, I'd be surprised. 


### Assignment/Exam Grades

**1. Who do I contact about extensions?**

For exams: Dr. Enbody (enbody@cse.msu.edu) or Dr. Zaabar (zaabarim@cse.msu.edu)

For everything else: me (letting4@msu.edu)

**2. When do our exam grades come back?**

If you took the exam on Mimir: _usually_ the day after all students have taken it (i.e. after makeups have finished, in most cases).

If you took the multiple choice paper exam: _usually_ up to a week after all students have taken it (i.e. after makeups have finished, in most cases).

**3. When do lab/project grades come back?**

_Usually_ the day after everyone in the section has finished, including anyone who had an extension.

**4. How do I view your project feedback?**

Go to your project submission, there should be a blue "View Feedback" button at the top-right of the page.

**5. Are there any exceptions for close final course grade cut-offs?**

Yes, actually. The professors will look for students who are at the edge of grade boundaries when the semester is over. They are stingier with rounding 4.0s, however. 

**6. Are there any extra credit assignments?**

_Sometimes_. I'm not sure when they happen, or for what reason. To me, it seems like it's just whenever Dr. Enbody feels like throwin one out. All instances where extra credit _has_ been served have been small, so don't get your hopes up.


### Academic Dishonesty Reports

**1. Do you know who has received an academic dishonesty report?**

No, unless the student tells me (you don't have to by any means). Academic dishonesty reports are kept private between the professors and the student in question, unless the TA was involved to some capacity.

I have caught plagiarizing students myself, however. I browse through at least one hundred projects every week (all of the section's + students on Piazza), I will occasionally spot similar solutions. 

**2. Have you had students in your section recieve academic dishonesty reports?**

Oh yes, many. It saddens me when it happens -- it feels like a failure on my part, which is why I stress doing your own work so much. I tend to have students that are very open with me, and so I'm aware of almost everyone in my past sections who has received one. I wish I could've stopped them. 

**3. What should I do if I receive an academic dishonesty report?**

You can either take the punishment or appeal. Convictions are usually made with strong evidence, however. I frankly don't know much about the ADR process, so I would visit the Office of the University Ombudsperson [website](https://ombud.msu.edu). 

**4. If you guys are constantly checking for similarities between hundreds of project files, isn't there bound to be at least two students who have similar code that have never spoken to each other?**

It can, and has happened -- so yes, but it is exceedingly rare. Less-experienced programmers are actually _less likely_ to have similar code to other people because their solutions tend to involve odd uses of the language, or strange work-arounds to problems, for which there could be millions of methodologies. 

Experienced programmers are _more likely_ to have similar code to other people because they know the most efficient way of tackling a problem, which tends to be a very limited amount of methodologies. 

It is easy for us to tell when a student plagiarizes in this course, since less-experienced programmers usually can't think of other/equivalent ways of programming an algorithm after seeing an already-implemented solution. The trouble really begins in later CSE courses, since students, by then, will know how to code equivalent expressions/algorithms from looking at their friend's solution.


### Miscellaneous/Personal

**1. Are we allowed to use a code editor that's not Spyder?**

Yep! Though bear in mind that the TAs and professors may not be familiar with how some of them work, you'll be on your own if you need help with it.

Other popular code editors:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Made by Microsoft, what I use)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Made by Apple, MacOS only)

Certain projects pull from 3rd party libraries near the end of the semester, (namely `pylab`), Spyder comes packaged with it, which is why we use Spyder in the first place. You'll have to manually install `pylab` if you're on a different code editor, which I can show you how to do if you can't figure it out for yourself.

**1. Why are the online exams proctored? That's so stupid.**

It *is* stupid, isn't it? You can ask the students who took this course in Spring 2020 for that answer.

Spoiler: everyone cheated when we didn't proctor. 

I originally had a huge rant as an answer for this question. Notify me if you ever want to read it. 

**2. Are there exam statistics anywhere?**

Dr. Enbody will have them in his post-exam email.

**3. How did you prepare for CSE231 exams?**

I went through the past exams and took them as if they were the real deal -- timer and all. I went back through questions I got wrong with PythonTutor, and asked about ones I didn't understand on Piazza. 

Come exam day, I drank a ludicrous amount of coffee... though I don't recommend doing that. Drink coffee safely, [studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-014-0563-8) have shown that caffeine does indeed improve cognitive function. 

**4. How did you do when you took this class?**

I got a 4.0, but I'm not smart by any means -- I just have _a lot_ of practice because I've been programming since I was a kid. If you're having a hard time, please don't compare your situation to people like me, because it's not the same. Programming is an extremely hard skill to master for a majority of people. The biggest thing you can do is practice. 

**5. Did you read the book?**

Nope, not a single word of it. But, again, I've been programming for a long time. Programming languages just kinda come naturally after you learn one (I knew a little Java before CSE231). I just used Piazza or did a quick Google search when I needed help with something.  

**6. Is using w3schools.com and/or programiz.com okay as supplementary material?**

Yep! Just be careful, websites like those may teach certain concepts in a different order, or may show some concepts that we don't teach at all. If you do come across something that we don't teach, it's usually safe to assume that you're not allowed to use it. If you're unsure if a concept may be used in an assignment, feel free to ask on Piazza.

**7. Do you use tabs or spaces?**

Tabs, I'm not tryna demolish my spacebar.

**8. Do you know any other programming languages?**

C, C++, JavaScript, and a minuscule amount of Java. I definitely use Python the most, however (you can tell if you look at my GitHub projects lol).

**9. Does the language you use matter?**

Kind of, it depends on what you're doing. If you need hyper-fast arithmetic, use C or C++. If you're doing anything web-related, then JavaScript is, and will always be, the industry standard -- you should definitely learn JavaScript at some point if you're a CSE major, you're going to need it. Python/Java can be used for everything else, though Java is mostly being phased out in favor of Python. 

If you're interested in data science and/or machine learning, Python is usually the industry language. You'll occasionally hear about R. 

**10. What is your ethnic background?**

I'm half white, half Korean. 

**11. Where are you from?**

Grand Rapids, Michigan. 

**12. Do you have social media?**

Hardly. I have a Twitter and a Snapchat, but I'm rarely ever on my phone in the first place. Talk with me if you want to add me. 

**13. What code editor do you use?**

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) by Microsoft. 

**14. How do you type so fast?**

Too much time spent writing essays in an IB high school. 

**15. Where can I apply to become a ULA for a CSE course?**

[Here](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Resources/EmploymentStudents.php). I had to finish CSE232 before Dr. Enbody would hire me, I'm unsure if that rule still applies. 

**16. Do you need a 4.0 to become a ULA for this class?**

Maybe? I actually have no idea, that'd be a good question for Dr. Enbody. If I had to guess, I'd say 3.5-4.0. Maybe 3.0 if you answer questions on Piazza frequently. You should still answer questions on Piazza even if you're in good standing grade-wise, it'll show that you're eager to help others. 

**17. Do you need to be a CSE major to become a ULA for this class?**

No, but Dr. Enbody probably wants you to be comfortable with programming in general. 

**18. How much do you get paid?**

$11/hour, though MSU had to reduce everyone's wage a little because of COVID-19 -- I'm not sure by how much for me, personally. I didn't take this job for the money. 

**19. Can you give me a referral?**

If I think you got what it takes, then maybe. Contact me about it.
